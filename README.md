## Overview

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out a bookmark landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users will be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

- GSAP motion
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework


### What I learned

While working on this project, i've learned working with NextJs and tsx template while playing with tailwind properties,i've seen the power of server side rendering 
i've also worked with animation so i've learned GSPA and i've used headlessUI belongs to tailwind.



### Useful resources

- [GSAP Animation](https://www.gsap.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [HeadlessUI](https://www.headlessUi.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
